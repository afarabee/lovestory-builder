story_suggestion.py

This module provides two core functions for handling AI-driven story refinements:
`build_suggestion()` and `apply_suggestion()`.

They form the bridge between AI-generated outputs (from refine_story, refine_field,
or generate_recommendations) and user-applied changes in the PO Toolkit App.

## üîÅ Overview of Roles

| Function            | Purpose                                                       | Trigger                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `build_suggestion()` | Creates a structured diff object after GPT modifies a story  | Called after refine or recommend  |
| `apply_suggestion()` | Applies the selected suggestion to the working story object  | Called when user clicks ‚ÄúApply‚Äù   |

---

## üî® `build_suggestion()`

### Purpose
- Compares two versions of a story
- Produces a structured suggestion object including:
  - Diff (patch-like list of changes)
  - Before/after story states
  - Metadata (model, timestamp, session)

### Developer Notes
- Uses a minimal diff algorithm to highlight changes
- Generates unique IDs with SHA
- Normalizes diff paths (e.g., `/acceptance_criteria/1`)
- Skips suggestions with no differences
- Does not mutate inputs

---

## ‚úÖ `apply_suggestion()`

### Purpose
- Accepts a suggestion object and merges it into the current story
- Performs optional drift check to detect differences from suggestion.before
- Returns a deep copy of the updated story

### Developer Notes
- Caller must handle undo stack, version snapshots, and dev notes regeneration
- Designed to be simple, non-blocking, and auditable

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

| Scenario                                | Expectation                                       |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| User applies full-scope suggestion      | Entire story updated; undo works                 |
| User applies field-level suggestion     | Only that field changes                          |
| Suggestion has no diff                  | Should be skipped or flagged                     |
| Drift detected                          | Warn or log discrepancy                          |
| Multiple suggestions applied sequentially | All tracked with unique IDs + metadata           |

---

## üîß Example UI/UX Tie-Ins

| UI Element      | Backed By                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Diff viewer      | `build_suggestion().diff`     |
| Undo button      | `apply_suggestion().before`   |
| Tooltip (source) | `suggestion.metadata.model`   |
| Audit trail      | `suggestion.id`, `created_at` |
