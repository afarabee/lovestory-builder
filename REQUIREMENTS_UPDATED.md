## Overview
This document outlines the **complete functional, behavioral, and UI/UX requirements** for the `Story Builder` application ‚Äî an AI-assisted tool that generates, refines, and manages agile user stories.

---

## 1. üß≠ Application Navigation

- **Initial Load Behavior**:
  - When app loads or user starts a new story, only the **Raw Input** section is visible (full screen width).
  - Sections like **User Story Details**, **Dev Notes**, **Push to ADO**, **Chat**, and **session Data** should be hidden.

- **Sidebar (Left Navigation)**:
  - Contains the following Quick Action buttons:
    1. `+ New User Story`
    2. `Restart Story`
    3. `Show session Data`
    4. `Version History`
  - Version History button opens a history panel.

- **Header (Top Right Controls)**:
  - `+ New User Story` (identical to sidebar action)
  - `Settings` (opens global project configuration modal)

---

## 2. üèóÔ∏è Story Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Raw Input
- Fields:
  - Feature Name
  - Feature Description
  - Role / Action / Goal trio
- Once filled, user clicks `Generate User Story`

### Step 2: Story Generation
- Triggering this reveals:
  - **User Story Details** panel (populated with title, description, and acceptance criteria)
  - **Dev Notes** section (optional technical context)
  - **Push to ADO** integration (placeholder)
  - **Story Refinement Chat** panel (expanded by default)
  - **Session Data Viewer** (if previously toggled)

---

## 3. üí¨ Story Refinement Chat

- Auto-expands when a story is generated.
- Collapse behavior:
  - Horizontal collapse button only (visible and styled clearly)
  - When collapsed, story builder expands to full screen
- **Chat Features**:
  - Users can type freeform refinement requests
  - Chatbot can return:
    - Description suggestions (‚úîÔ∏è Apply Suggestion button shown)
    - Title suggestions (‚úîÔ∏è Apply Suggestion button shown)
    - Acceptance criteria suggestions (‚úîÔ∏è Apply Suggestion shown)
    - General guidance (no Apply button)
- Apply Suggestion behavior:
  - Updates **only** the session data in memory (not saved anywhere permanent)
  - Must be tied to valid suggestion type (title, description, AC)
  - Suggestions without actionable content do not show the Apply button.
- Undo Suggestion:
  - Shows as a button immediately after an applied change
  - Clicking it reverts session data to prior state
- Avoid repetitive phrases like ‚ÄúI understand you want to refine‚Ä¶‚Äù to keep interaction natural.
- Chat should focus suggestions on Title, Description, and AC ‚Äî not session Data
- Chat must respond to nonsense input by mocking realistic suggestions for demo purposes
- Add sticky `Scroll to Bottom` button and auto-scroll to newest message

---

## 4. üß™ Session Data Viewer
- The term ‚ÄúSession Data‚Äù is the canonical name for the in-memory, editable story state used during refinement and chat interactions. All references to previous terms such as ‚ÄúTest Data‚Äù must be replaced consistently to avoid ambiguity.
- Initially hidden
- Can be toggled on via `Show Session Data` button in sidebar
- Only visible after story is generated
- Automatically disappears if not manually enabled and chat is opened
- Purpose:
  - Shows internal session data structure used by chat
  - Allows Apply Suggestion to update it
- No banner or "session data updated" messages should be shown to user

---

## 5. üï∞Ô∏è Version History

- Located in the **sidebar**.
- Automatically creates new version snapshots:  
  - On every update to Title, Description, or Acceptance Criteria, debounced to no more than once every 10 seconds to avoid excessive snapshots during rapid edits.
  - At set intervals (e.g., every 2 minutes) while the user is actively editing.
- The system retains a maximum of 50 snapshots per story, pruning oldest versions automatically.
- Each version snapshot includes:  
  - Timestamp  
  - Snapshot of Title, Description, and Acceptance Criteria as they existed at the time
- Per-version options:  
  - `View Diff`: opens side-by-side comparison of changes across all fields  
  - `Restore`: replaces current story with that version‚Äôs data, **after user confirmation**  
  - `Apply this version`: applies story content, **after user confirmation**, and keeps version history open for further review  
- Confirmation dialogs for Restore and Apply include **Confirm** and **Cancel** buttons; Cancel aborts action and keeps the view open.  
- Users exit version history via the **Close** button or **Escape** key, without further prompts.
- All interactions support keyboard and screen reader accessibility.

---

## 6. üõ†Ô∏è Settings

- Only accessible from top right header
- Opens modal overlay that blocks interaction with the main UI until explicitly closed by the user
- Fields include:
  - Project Metadata: Essential contextual information about the project that must be referenced by the language model (LLM) during story generation.
  - Azure DevOps (ADO) Integration: Configuration to specify the target ADO organization, project, and repository where stories will be created. This setting determines the destination for all push-to-ADO operations.
  - GitHub Repository Integration (optional): Configuration details for linking to source code repositories to enrich AI context.
  - Prompting Behavior Preferences: User-configurable settings that guide how the LLM formulates story content, such as tone, level of detail, or template adherence.
  - File Library for Knowledge Base: Upload and manage project-specific documents and reference files that serve as supplemental knowledge sources for the AI prompt.
- The application must incorporate these project settings and files as part of the LLM input prompts when generating or refining stories, ensuring AI outputs are contextually relevant and aligned with project standards.
- Must remain open until user explicitly exits

---

## 7. üßº New User Story Flow

- Action from header or sidebar
- Displays confirmation modal:
  - "Are you sure you want to start a new story? This will clear your draft."
  - Buttons: `Cancel`, `Confirm`
- On Confirm:
  - Clears current story, session data, and chat history
  - Reverts UI to show **only Raw Input** full screen
  - Chat panel, story details, dev notes, and ADO sections must be hidden again

---

## 8. üîÑ General UI Rules

- No vertical expand/collapse buttons for chat
- Collapsing chat horizontally should:
  - Hide panel entirely
  - Expand Story Builder view to full width
- Chat panel should **auto-scroll** to show lasession response
  - Include sticky `Scroll to Bottom` button
- Avoid repeated phrases like "I understand you want to refine..."

---

## 9. üì¶ Miscellaneous Requirements

- Only show the ‚ö†Ô∏è AC warning icon if title or description has changed
- Suggestions from chat must reflect capabilities of current UI (e.g. no "split into multiple stories")
- Diff views in Version History must show all changed fields, not just description
- All "Apply Suggestion" operations must be constrained to session data fields and not shown if the suggestion isn‚Äôt actionable in the UI

---

## 10. ADO Requirements
- Creating a work item via push to ADO results in a Product Backlog Item (PBI) of type ‚ÄúStory‚Äù within the Area Path defined in the Story Builder‚Äôs Project Settings.
- The Iteration Path and Tags applied in ADO exactly match those specified in the Story Builder configuration for the story.
- The ‚Äúchatgpt‚Äù tag (case-sensitive) is automatically added to every created story in ADO.
- The Created By field on the ADO story correctly reflects the user‚Äôs name who performed the push, not a system or service account.
- All Acceptance Criteria are formatted as bullet points, preserving clear, individual criteria lines within the story.
