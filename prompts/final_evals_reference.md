# üõë `final_evals()` ‚Äì Function Reference

The `final_evals()` function is the **last validation gate** before pushing a user story to Azure DevOps (ADO). It ensures the story meets all technical and compliance requirements for export.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Triggered just before the push to ADO, this function performs strict validations on:

1. Required fields for ADO schema
2. Tag and field formatting
3. Compliance checks (e.g., no PII, secure phrasing)
4. Dev notes presence (if required)
5. Adherence to story formatting and structure expectations

If any validation fails, the export is blocked and the user is shown remediation guidance.
