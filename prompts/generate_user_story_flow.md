When user clicks the "Generate User Story" button, invoking the `generate_user_story` function, here's a breakdown of what each of those fields represents in the code:

## Input Fields and Their Purpose

* **`raw_input`**: This is the most important field. It's where you type the basic user story statement, like "As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access if I forget it." This is the core instruction the AI will use to build the story.

* **`context`**: This is a dictionary that holds key information about the project and the target audience. It contains fields like:
    * `project_name`: The name of your project.
    * `project_description`: A brief summary of what the project is about.
    * `persona`: The type of user the story is for (e.g., "Research models buyer").
    * `tone`: The style of writing the AI should use (e.g., "Professional").
    * `format`: This tells the AI what kind of output you want, in this case, a "User Story".

* **`custom_prompt`**: This is a flexible field for adding specific instructions or nuances to your request. For example, if you want the story to focus on security, you would add that here. The AI will use this to fine-tune its response.

* **`file_content`**: This is a placeholder for the content of any documents you might want the AI to reference. It's a way to inject specific knowledge, like a company style guide or technical specifications, into the prompt.

* **`project_context`**: This is another field for providing additional details about the project that aren't covered in the `context` dictionary. It's a way to give the AI more background information to improve the quality of the generated story.

* **`model`**: This field specifies which AI model to use for the generation. In this case, it's set to "gpt-4o", which is a powerful model for understanding complex instructions.

All of these fields are combined to create a single, comprehensive **`instruction`** that is sent to the OpenAI API. The more information you provide in these fields, the better and more accurate the generated user story will be.
