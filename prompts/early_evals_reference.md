# ‚úÖ `early_evals()` ‚Äì Function Reference

The `early_evals` function acts as a **quality gate immediately after story generation**, before the story is rendered in the UI. Its goal is to ensure the generated content meets internal quality, structure, and safety standards.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Triggered after the `generate_user_story()` function completes, `early_evals()` performs automated validation checks on the story JSON, including:

1. INVEST compliance
2. Proper formatting of Acceptance Criteria
3. Presence of required fields (Title, Description, AC, Points, Tags)
4. Content safety (PII, hallucinations, length)
5. Adherence to organizational style rules (e.g., no Gherkin, no DoD)

If any check fails, the story is not shown in the UI. Instead, remediation suggestions or fallback options are surfaced.
